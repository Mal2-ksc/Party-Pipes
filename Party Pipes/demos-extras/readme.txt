Party Pipes 3.23.06 by Malaclypse the Younger, mal2fnord@gmail.com.

Party Pipes is a collection of wind (and in one case, percussion) instruments that feature similar controls. All samples were recorded and processed by me personally.

The individual SFZ files map to instruments as follows:
• Big Stick - Alto clarinet in E♭*. Range D#1 to A#4, extrapolated down to A#0.
• Licorice Stick - Clarinet in B♭. Range D2 to A#5, with extrapolated samples down to A1.
• Plastic Fruit - Treble flute in G, made of plastic pipe. Range F#3 to A6, with extrapolated samples down to B2.
• Singing Straws - Pan pipes made of 1 cm wide plastic straws. Range B2 to A6.
• Paper Lion - PDQ Bach "windbreaker". Plastic and/or cardboard cylindrical tubes which are played by buzzing. Range G0 to C4, but the expressive range is much less.
• Magical Fruit - Alto (octave higher) version of "windbreaker" but all plastic. Range is A1 to C5, matching the lower range of a 3-valve E♭ "tenor horn".
• Slap Stick - Slapophone, featuring 11 velocity layers. Range is C0 to D4. Keyboard optimized only.

There are two versions provided for most of the instruments.
• The base version is optimized for use with a breath controller, EWI, or similar.
  This links breath to volume and to layer mixing in real time, and ignores velocity.
• The [keys] version uses only velocity to determine volume and layer mixing.
  Master Volume (CC7) will allow for crescendos and decrescendos, but there is no
  provision for altering the layer mixing once a note starts. 

The B♭ clarinet has been provided with extra range (thanks to plumbing parts) to enable
playing parts written for basset clarinet (pitched in A, with a low C extension)
although the B♭/B♮ break is modeled on an ordinary B♭ clarinet. Both clarinets and
the alto windbreaker use three sample layers for dynamics, while the pan pipes and
flute use two layers and a noise generator. The larger windbreaker uses just one layer
(but two round robins) and a noise generator.

*Sampled instrument is a Bundy Selmer E♭ alto clarinet, extended range to written
low C provided by attaching plumbing parts again, and further extended range to bass
clarinet low C (an additional perfect fourth) is extrapolated from the lowest samples.
The demo for "Hat and Beard" sets the Resonance control to 40% to get a more bass
clarinet like sound.

Paper Lion: Like pan pipes, each note has its own tube. Unlike pan pipes, sound is generated by buzzing, like any brass instrument. Real sustain at forte is much less than presented here (2 to 4 seconds, not 6), as a lot of air is required.

Magical Fruit: The alto (octave higher, and plastic) version of the Windbreaker. The
headjoint cork was removed from the plastic G flute, the embouchure hole was taped
over, and I played it like a cornetto. Sometimes I played it from the foot end.

All of the above are built for use as monophonic instruments.
To play legato, run the notes into each other. As long as they "touch" or overlap, they should slur. However, the Sostenuto pedal (CC 66) also applies this articulation.

Modulation depth can be controlled either with the usual CC1, or with CC21
because that's what my EWI's bite sensor is set to. (And they stack.)

Slap Stick: This one functions a bit different. There is no breath-optimized version since this is a percussion instrument, but it's still made of pipes so included in this suite. The controls are very limited, and all samples are played as one-shots (no way to stop them but they're only 750 ms long at most). All samples are derived from a single 160 cm × 4.6 cm ID pipe (the A#1 sample set), with 11 separate velocity layers.
