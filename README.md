# Party-Pipes
This package contains seven sampled instruments: pan pipes, plastic flute in treble G, a blown beer bottle filled to various levels, clarinet in B♭, alto clarinet in E♭, and two sizes of windbreaker (a PDQ Bach instrument). The sampled “generator” for the pan pipes is me blowing across 1 cm wide party straws with the end stopped, and the treble G flute is the one pictured. The clarinets are standard band issue, with range extended (with plumbing) and extrapolated (digitally shifted and formant-compensated).

♪	This is not technically a mono synth, but it is intended to be used like one -- one instance per voice if you want to stack chords or whatever.
♪	Designed and optimized for use with a breath controller (or EWI or similar).
♪	If you are using a breath controller, the mix of volume layers you get is controlled entirely by Breath (CC2) and can be shaped for the entire duration of the note. Velocity is ignored.
♪	A keyboard-friendly (no breath control) version is also provided, although it lacks the ability to change layer blending during a note.
♪	Samples in OGG format (quality 10/10) to save space.
♪	Typically 4 samples/octave (some 3/octave for Paper Lion) except in extended range.
♪	No samples are looped. Paper Lion has 6 seconds of sustain per sample, Magical Fruit has 10, others are 12.
♪	Legato can be selected by the Sostenuto pedal (CC66), or automatically engaged by overlapping/touching note durations.
♪	Resonance control (CC9) shifts timbre. 50% is normal, low = “bigger” and high = “smaller”.
♪	Panpipes & flute: Added breath noise can be mixed and low pass filtered (CC5, CC6)
♪	All others: Control for delay before the modulation engages.

♪	Big Stick (alto clarinet) range: A#0 (extended)/D#1 to A#4.
♪	Licorice Stick (clarinet) range: A1 (extended)/D2 to A#5.
♪	Plastic Fruit (treble G flute) range: B2 (extended)/G3 to A6.
♪	Singing Straws (pan pipes) range: B2 to A6.
♪	Beer Goggles (blown bottles) range: C3 to F6.
♪	Paper Lion (baritone windbreaker) range: G0 (extended)/C1 to C4.
♪	Magical Fruit (alto windbreaker) range: A1 to C5. Same hardware as Plastic Fruit, but used quite differently.
